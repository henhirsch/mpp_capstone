## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# ```{r setup, include = FALSE}
# knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
# ```

```{r load packages}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(usmap)
library(ggrepel)
```

The `i_am` function identifies where the Rmd is located within the main project directory. All future calls to files are based on their relative location to the project root.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# set location of this file in project directory
i_am("code/capstone_graphics.Rmd")

# point to datasets
data_file1 = "data/DMDC_Website_Location_Report_2312_clean.xlsx"
data_file2 = "data/nccs.csv"
```


```{r load data}
# load csv using here
headcount0 <- read_excel(here(data_file1))
nccs0 <- read.csv(here(data_file2))
```


``` {r manipulate data}
state_headcounts <- headcount0[c(1:4, 7:53), 1:8]
colnames(state_headcounts) <- c("state", "army", "naval", "marines", "air", "space", "coast", "active_duty_total")

```


``` {r generate US headcount graphic}
us_map_headcount <- plot_usmap(regions = "states", data = state_headcounts, values = "active_duty_total", labels = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Active Duty Personnel in the United States",
       subtitle = "Would per capita be more helpful?") + 
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "white", high = "#454B1B", name = "Number of Personnel", label = scales::comma) + 
  theme(panel.background=element_blank(),
        legend.position = "right")
us_map_headcount
```
